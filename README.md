# node-polling-to-event
Receive events with EventEmitter from a polling function ran on an interval


Technically speaking [polling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_%28computer_science%29) is defined as status check from an external device,
but with **node-polling-to-event** you can expect events from your own function that polls whatever resource you want that implies either a synchronous or an asynchronous operation.

## Installation

    $ npm install polling-to-event

## Usage

```Javascript
    var pollingtoevent = require("polling-to-event");

    var emitter = pollingtoevent(function(done) {
      // your async stuff
      // ....
      done(null, arg1, arg2, ..., argN);
    });

    emitter.on("poll", function(data) {
      console.log(data);
    });

    emitter.on("err", function(err) {
      console.log(err);
    });    
```

## HTTP request *polling* example
```Javascript
    var pollingtoevent = require("polling-to-event"),
      request = require("request");

    var url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/contribute.json/master/schema.json";

    emitter = pollingtoevent(function(done) {
      request.get(url, function(err, req, data) {
        done(err, data);
      });
    });

    emitter.on("poll", function(data) {
      console.log("Event emitted at %s, with data %j", Date.now(), data);
    });

    emitter.on("error", function(err, data) {
      console.log("Emitter errored: %s. with data %j", err, data);
    });
```

## HTTP Rrequest *Long polling* example

  If you set the option `longpolling:true` the emitter will emit an *longpoll* event when
  the **polled data differs**. In the example custom interval (in msecs) and custom event name have been specified. 

```Javascript
    emitter = pollingtoevent(function(done) {
      request.get(url, function(err, req, data) {
        done(err, data);
      });
    }, {
      longpolling:true,
      longpollEventName: "MyLongPoll",
      interval: 350
    });

    emitter.on("MyLongPoll", function(data) {
      console.log("longpoll emitted at %s, with data %j", Date.now(), data);
    });
```

## API

#### pollingtoevent(pollingfunction, options)

It creates an event emitter that emits the polled data on an interval.

Your polling function will be called right away, and at the end of every interval.

**Arguments**
* `pollingfunction(done)` - **Required**. The function you want to be called at an interval. When called, this function will receive a `done` parameter as its last argument.
  * `done(error, arg1, arg2, ... argN) ` - You must call **done()**  inside your function when your function finish its work.
    * `error` - **Required**. Call `done()` with `null` as its first argument if there was no error. Call it with an [error object](https://www.joyent.com/developers/node/design/errors) instance as first argument if you wish the emitter to emit an `error` event..  
    * `arg1, arg2, ... argN` - The data fetched by your polling function. Your `pollingfunction` passes this arguments to `done()` in order to be emitted by the emitter. Any number of arguments will do.  
* `options` - **Optional**. An `Object` having any of the following keys:
  * `interval` - Interval in milliseconds. **Default**: 1000.
  * `longpolling` - Set to true if you want to be notified when data from the last poll differ from previous polled data. The data taken for comparison is every argument your `pollingfunction` passes to `done()`. The comparison is made with [deep-equal](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deep-equal). **Default:** `false`.
  * `eventName` - The event name to emit on each successful call to `done()`. **Default**: `"poll"`.
  * `longpollEventName` - The event name to emit when last polled data differs from previous polling data. **Default**: `"longpoll"`.

**Returns**

Returns an [EventEmitter](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter) instance with some extra methods. See [Methods](#emitter-methods).

#### Emitter events

* `poll` - Emitted when an interval has completed and the `done()` function was called with no errors. *You can also customize this event's name using the option `eventName`*. **Parameters**: Your listener gets the parameter passed to `done()` with exception of the error parameter which is the first parameter `done()` uses.
* `error` - Emitted when `done()` was called with an error object. It emits the data polled by your polling function.  **Parameters**. An error object.
* `longpoll` - Emitted when option `longpolling` is true and the last polled data differs from the previous polling data. **Parameters**: Your listener gets the parameter received by `done()` with exception of the error parameter which is the first parameter `done()` uses. *You can also customize this event's name using the option `longpollEventName`*

#### Emitter methods

##### pause()

Pauses the interval.

##### resume()

Resumes the interval if it has been paused

##### clear()

Clears the interval timer


## TODO

* Add a default behaviour to poll URLs via a `GET` request if an URL string is passed as argument instead of a function.
